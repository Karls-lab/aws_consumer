When a widget needs to be stored in the DynamoTable, place every widget attribute in the
request its own attribute in the DynamoDB object. In other words, in addition to the widget_id,
owner, label, and description, all the properties listed in the otherAttributes properties need to
be stored as attributes in the DynamoDB object and not as single map or list.
